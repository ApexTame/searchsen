# Searchsen

An extension created with React and TypeScript that allows you to search the chat of Twitch VODs.

## Building

1. `npm i` to install dependancies
2. `npm run build` to geenrate a Webpack production build in the `dist` folder

## Where to get

- You can build from source
- You can get it at the Google Chrome Webstore

## Limitations

- It might not work very well with VODs that are over 24hrs long as processing them will be very expensive.
- The messages might not get wrapped around if they are too long. Will be fixed in upcoming releases.

## Future Updates

- Will add search by username functionality.
- Will add emote support.
